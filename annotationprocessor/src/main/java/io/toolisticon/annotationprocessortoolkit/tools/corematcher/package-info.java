/**
 * This package contains the implementation classes for the different kinds of CoreMatchers.
 *
 * Currently there are the following CoreMatcher types:
 *
 * - Implicit matchers (no arguments)
 * - Is matcher (no arguments like implicit matcher, but changes element type)
 * - Characteristic matchers
 * --> Inclusive matchers (Matcher none, one, at least one or all characteristics)
 * --> Exclusive matchers (Matches none or one characteristic)
 *
