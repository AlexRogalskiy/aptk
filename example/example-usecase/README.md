# Annotation-Processor-Toolkit Example Usecase

This example usecase demonstrates how the annotation processor can be used.

Feel free to play around a bit and to change the example usecase into invalid usage of the annotations.
Afterwards build everything with:

    mvn clean install

In this case of broken constraints compiling of the example should result into a compile error.

This will be shown both on console and even in your IDE.
